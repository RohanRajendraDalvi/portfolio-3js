## 💡 Value Proposition
I accelerate engineering teams by combining systems thinking with hands‑on delivery in performance, multimedia, and developer enablement. Recent focus areas:
* AR & Edge Optimization: GPU-aware Kotlin migrations and low-level pipeline tuning for wearable devices.
* Reliability & Quality at Scale: Standardized multi-platform QA (500+ tests) cutting cycle time by 70%.
* Real-Time Collaboration: Multi-peer WebRTC prototypes supporting high‑concurrency proctored sessions.
* Computer Vision Evolution: Progressed from classical OpenCV pipelines to TensorFlow.js in-browser inference.
* Secure Interaction Models: Mixed cipher + OTP flows for privacy-focused communication apps.
* Learning Platform Impact: Scalable course infrastructure (React / Jest / Cypress / Docker) enabling 400+ learners.
* 3D & Visual Experience: GPU-accelerated, accessible WebGL/Three.js interfaces with progressive loading.

## 🧩 Architecture Notes
* Components in `src/components`; data-driven config in `src/constants`.
* `src/assets/index.js` as a typed import hub for tree-shaking.
* 3D scenes separated under `canvas` for future lazy-loading.
* Opportunities: dynamic imports for heavy scenes; service worker caching.

## ⚙️ Local Development
Requires Node.js 22+ (see `.nvmrc`).

```powershell
nvm use 22.0.0
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production build:
```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🔐 Email Contact (Environment)
Create an EmailJS account and add the following to a `.env` file (or your Vercel dashboard):
```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

## 📈 Performance & Future Optimizations
